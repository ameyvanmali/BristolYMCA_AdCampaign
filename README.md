# BristolYMCA_AdCampaign
This project was driven by Google Ad Words platform. My team participated in Google Ad Grants online Marketing challenge and we were allocated an NGO called BristoylYMCA to run online marketing campaign for them. Since we completed the Ad grants challenge, google sponcered us for running google ad campaign for the organization.
Here is some background about YMCA: YMCA, also known as Y, is the nation's leading nonprofit working towards empowering communities through youth development, healthy living and social responsibility. Y is a spirit, a movement and a cause who promote values such as care, honesty, respect, responsibility, and faith.
We setup our meetings with the organization on their expectations from this campaign and set up a plan accordingly for the next four weeks.
Later on we started focusing on three main campaigns namely: increasing awareness, volunteer participation, & contribution (donation)
We employed appropriate keywords using Ad Words account and run the campaign.
We monitored performance of the keywords each day and continued the campaign with necessary modifications required in the keywords.
Finally, we successfully generated 806 impressions and a total CTR of 15.51% resulting in better ad position on Google Search results.
